# Tribo_python project
Play with tribology curves by python

### Usage
Copy the corresponding .py file (except 01_import_data.py) into working folder (C:\ProgramData\Anton Paar\Common files\scripts\src), 
and make some small modifications, including:
* change the name to tribo_* (e.g. 02_plot_first_measurement.py => tribo_plot_first_measurement.py)
* comment out the non necessary import statements (marked inside the .py files)
* modify the tool.ini to add the file path in tribometer software (Tools | Configure tools...) and then reload
